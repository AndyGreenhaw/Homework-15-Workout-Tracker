## Description

The purpose of this application is to create the illusion that a user can add exercises and track them in the stats. But in reality, this application enables users to add custom exercises to a database, and then see the last workout they added after clicking complete. If they click "Dashboard" at the top of the page, it takes them to a stats page that provides tons of interactive information about the exercises that were added to the data base, and when they were added.

## Installation

To install this application, visit Andy Greenhaw's GitHub profile at the url provided, and clone the Homework 15 Fitness App to your local machine. From there, you simply need to NPM install, run the seed data (optional), and node or nodemon the server.

## Usage

Visit the url [https://fierce-taiga-31557.herokuapp.com/] and you will see the last workout that was created in the database. Click "New Workout" to add a new workout to the database, or click "Continue Workout" to edit the last-created workout. Either option will take you to a dropdown menu where you can select either a Resistance or Cardio Exercise Type. The Resistance Type enables the user to enter an exercise name, weight, sets, reps, and a duration. The Cardio Type enables the user to enter an exercise name, distance, and duration. After all the information is filled out, the user can click "Add Exercise" to add the new workout to the database. Clicking "Complete" will bring the user back to the main Fitness Tracker dashboard, where they will see their newly added exercise. Finally, clicking "Stats" at the top of the page will enable the user to see a plethora of useless data about when they added these exercises to the database.
